Racetrax(TM)
-----------
This is a game that some company from Australia licenses to state lottery commissions.

You watch 12 simulated horsed race. 1 is the fastest horse, usually, 12 the slowest, usually. The game is set up so that the odds of any particular horse winning is the same from race to race.

Races happen every 5 minutes. This is only a constraint on how many tickets you can buy in the time window.

There are a lot of possible bets, I would guess there is a bet for every probability and prize point.

Some things I'd like to explore:
----------
Can combinations of Racetrax bets replicate the odds or prize you get with other games? For example, which racetrax bet is the equivallent to a straight pick 3 bet in terms of odds or prize?

Something the computer can't tell me is: does gambling on Racetrax encourage or discourage society from raising more horses for horse racing?

Are straight bets better or combo bets? My hypothesis is that straight bets are better because they increase the risk of gambler's ruin.

Which ticket minimizes gamblers ruin?

Are there pairs of similar bets where one is better than the other because of rounding errors?
